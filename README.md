# Destini ðŸ¤”

This project comes from the flutter course I took, which you can find [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/). While coding, i thought I'd give it some twist just to see if i could make it a bit more interesting.

## My twist
I replaced the story array with a graph-like data structure adding a dedicated class to the choices. It's nothing difficult really, but i think that beginners could benefit from seeing some sort of application of data structures in a project they made. 

The idea is seeing the texts as nodes and choices as arches.
Of course this could be more destructured, by adding two arrays in the storybrain containing, respectively, the nodes and the arches and then linking them with a hashmap, i just thought that would be an overkill.

Feel free to send pull requests if you want to improve this even more!
Just mind that I did this in a hurry and so the stories' initialization is terryfing :bow:
